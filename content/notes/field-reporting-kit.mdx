summary: Lightweight kit for capturing sound, ambient data, and sketches during on-site research days.

I carry a minimal rig while biking between client sites:

1. Tiny binaural microphones patched into a pocket recorder.
2. A resin-printed jig that holds a phone for quick photogrammetry scans.
3. Waterproof notebook with templated prompts: _who was present_, _what shifted_, _next input_.

The outputs feed straight into `/memory` and seed new project briefs. Having a consistent kit means less time packing and
more time observing.
