summary: Principles behind the new dark garden interface and how it organizes notes by memory weight.
---

The garden changed shape after mapping how often each note was revisited. Instead of chronological lists, the surface now
prioritizes **memory weight**: a blend of recency, references, and tags shared across projects.

## Heuristics

- Keep everything legible in a single dark palette with no neon distractions.
- Tie each note to a _memory anchor_ so that the /memory feed can resurface context.
- Prefer MDX for inline sketches, callouts, and data snippets.

When the heuristics are followed, the garden feels like a calm terminal. Every section looks deliberate and consistent,
even as the content evolves.
