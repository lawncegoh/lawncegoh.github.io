summary: Snapshot of the current studio stack across infrastructure, research, and publishing layers.

The stack will change again, but right now it looks like this:

```text
Research Notes  → Obsidian synced to git
APIs            → Cloudflare Workers, FastAPI
Front-end       → Next.js App Router
Edge storage    → R2 and D1 for structured notes
```

The most important part is the publishing workflow: MDX content lives in `/content`, gets parsed during the build, and
ships everywhere via a static export. Nothing fancy, just reliable.
